Northeastern University (NU or NEU) is a private research university with its main campus in Boston. 
Established in 1898, the university offers undergraduate and graduate programs on its main campus in 
Boston as well as satellite campuses in Charlotte, North Carolina; Seattle, Washington; San Jose, California; 
Oakland, California; Portland, Maine; and Toronto and Vancouver in Canada. In 2019, Northeastern purchased 
the New College of the Humanities in London, England. The university's enrollment is approximately 19,000 
undergraduate students and 8,600 graduate students. It is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities
Very high research activity". Northeastern faculty and alumni include Nobel Prize laureates, Rhodes, Truman, 
and Marshall scholars. Undergraduate admission to the university is categorized as "most selective."

Northeastern features a cooperative education program, more commonly known as "co-op," that integrates 
classroom study with professional experience and includes over 3,100 partners across all seven continents. 
The program has been a key part of Northeastern's curriculum of experiential learning for more than a hundred 
years and is one of the largest co-op/internship programs in the world. While not required for all academic
disciplines, participation is nearly universal among undergraduate students. Northeastern also has a
comprehensive study abroad program that spans more than 170 universities and colleges.

Northeastern is a large, highly residential university. Most undergraduate students choose to live on campus but 
third-years and above have the option to live off campus. Seventy-eight percent of Northeastern students receive 
some form of financial aid. In the 2020–21 school year, the university has committed $355 million in grant and 
scholarship assistance. In 2019, Northeastern's six-year graduation rate was 89 percent.

The university's sports teams, the Northeastern Huskies, compete in NCAA Division I as members of the 
Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) in 18 varsity sports. The men's and women's hockey teams compete 
in Hockey East, while the men's and women's rowing teams compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing 
Colleges (EARC) and Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges (EAWRC), respectively. Men's Track 
and Field has won the CAA back to back years in 2015 and 2016. In 2013, men's basketball won its first 
CAA regular season championship, men's soccer won the CAA title for the first time, and women's ice 
hockey won a record 16th Beanpot championship. The Northeastern men's hockey team won the 2018, 2019, 
and 2020 Beanpot, defeating Boston University, Boston College, and Harvard.

Here's a Christmas quiz question for you: how many Spider-Man films 
have there been in the past 20 years? By my count, there were three 
directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, two directed by Marc 
Webb and starring Andrew Garfield, one animation, Spider-Man: Into the 
Spider-Verse, and two recent outings directed by Jon Watts and starring 
Tom Holland. That makes the third Watts-Holland film, Spider-Man: No Way Home, 
the ninth opportunity we've had to see Peter Parker in his blue and red 
spandex – and that's not including his appearances with The Avengers and Captain America.

Admittedly, that would seem to be more than enough. But the magic of No Way Home 
is that it uses all of those previous Spider-Man films to its advantage. Yes, the 
references to what we might call Spider-Man Parts One to Eight are reliant on the 
nostalgic loyalty of Spider-fans, but they also enrich the new film, increasing its 
emotional depth and range. They even enhance the earlier films, retroactively, adding 
new facets to characters we thought we'd seen the last of, and giving them the 
momentous send-offs they might not have had the last time around. Superhero-sceptics 
probably won't be converted. But if you have any love for the genre, then No Way Home 
will put a silly grin on your face for two hours, and might just put a few tears in your eyes.

It all starts with the unmasking of Spider-Man. Back in the Raimi-Maguire era, J Jonah Jameson, 
as played by the magnificently grumpy JK Simmons, was the editor of a big city newspaper. 
In a slyly satirical update, he returns now as the presenter of his own conspiracy-based 
news website – and he still loathes your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. When he tells 
the world that Spidey is really Peter Parker, the legal ramifications vanish rather too quickly, 
but the bad publicity is enough to stop Peter, his sardonic girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and his 
nerdy buddy Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) being accepted by the college of their choice. 
Overreacting somewhat, Peter begs Marvel's resident wizard, Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), 
to cast a spell that will erase his dual identity from the memories of everyone in the universe. 
Alas, the spell goes wrong, and the Doctor accidentally summons various people from other universes instead.

Anyone who has glimpsed the trailers or publicity interviews will know that those people 
include the crazed Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) from Raimi's first Spider-Man film, the haughty 
Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) from his second, plus Electro (Jamie Foxx) from Webb's 
The Amazing Spider-Man 2. They're joined by some other characters, but I won't spoil the fun by 
saying who they are. What I will reveal is the film's most inspired twist. Doctor Strange 
wants to zap these interlopers back to the alternate realities where they belong, but Peter 
works out that in those realities, the supervillains will be killed in fights with Spider-Man. 
Rather than sending them to their deaths in another dimension, he insists on attempting to reform them. 
His mission, as he puts it, is not to "kick some ass", but to "cure some ass".

Of course, this is a disastrously foolhardy idea, but it makes a refreshing change 
from the mass-destruction schemes of most superhero films. And, in its noble naivety, 
Peter's plan brings the story of Spider-Man back to the theme which defined the original comics: 
the sacrifices, painful consequences and great responsibilities that come with great power. 
If the last two Watts-Holland films leant too heavily on Peter's relationships with such well-connected, 
jet-setting alpha males as Tony Stark and Nick Fury, this one remembers that he is essentially a scruffy, 
stressed New York kid who is trying to figure things out for 

It's fair to say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse dealt with the concept of alternate 
universes even more brilliantly in 2018. It's also true that if the most exciting part of 
No Way Home is the return of people who were in other films, then it falls short of the seminal 
Raimi-Maguire movies. But there is no denying the thrill of seeing so many of the series' finest 
actors and most iconic characters together in one place. The filmmakers are careful not to overdo 
the winking postmodernism, too. Between their comic chemistry and their tragic flaws, there is 
something engagingly human about these superhumans.

The action sequences in No Way Home are fast and frenetic yet always coherent, and the post-Inception, 
city-twisting digital effects are spectacular. But the film's real superpowers are its 
endearing performances, and a screenplay by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers that interweaves 
teen-angst soap opera and cosmic calamity with all the goofy logic and tonal nimbleness that 
make the best superhero comics so appealing.

Besides, No Way Home isn't just about looking back at old films. It also opens up new 
avenues for the Marvel Universe – or the Marvel Multiverse, to be more accurate. Until now, 
this hasn't been the most successful year for the studio's blockbusters. Black Widow, 
Shang-Chi and the Legend of The Ten Rings, and Eternals were all promisingly progressive 
on paper but underwhelming on screen. Collectively, they left me feeling that Marvel had run 
out of steam, at least as far as its cinematic ventures were concerned. 
But No Way Home left me eager to see where Spidey and Doctor Strange might go 
next – and that makes this Spider-Man one of the most amazing Spider-Mans of all.

Ukraine has updated its extensive wishlist of additional military assistance 
from the US government in the past several days to include hundreds more 
anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles than previously requested, according to a 
document provided to CNN that details the items needed.
The Ukrainians have submitted similar lists in recent weeks but a recent request 
provided to US lawmakers appears to reflect a growing need for American-made Stinger 
anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles -- with Ukraine saying it urgently needs 500 of each, daily. 

In both cases, Ukraine is asking for hundreds more missiles 
than were included in a similar list recently provided to US 
lawmakers, according to a source with knowledge of both requests.

The new list comes as the Ukrainians have claimed they face potential 
weapons shortages amid an ongoing Russian assault -- prompting some pushback 
from US and NATO officials who stress that more military aid is already going into the country.

By March 7, less than two weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 
the US and other NATO members had sent about 17,000 anti-tank missiles 
and 2,000 anti-aircraft missiles into Ukraine.

Since then, NATO countries, including the US, have kept the pipeline of 
weapons and equipment flowing, even as Russia has threatened to target the shipments.
The last of a US $350 million security assistance packaged approved 
in late February arrived in Ukraine within the last few days, a senior 
defense official said, while the next two packages totaling $1 billion have already started to arrive.
